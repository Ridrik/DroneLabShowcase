# DroneLab Showcase

DroneLab is a C++ based simulation and visualization tool for autonomous drones. It provides live and replay sessions with full telemetry, 3D trajectory visualization, and configurable flight parameters. This tool is ideal for learning, experimentation, and demonstration of guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) algorithms.

## Key Features

- Configurable Editor: Load, save, and tweak flight parameters, environment settings, sensors, and estimators.
- Flight Modes: Waypoint following, return-to-launch (RTL), with additional modes planned.
- Simulation Control: Pause, slow and speed up simulation; Switch view between drone orbit mode or free mode
- Live interaction: add waypoints on screen, disable/enable sensors such as GPS and Magnetometer.
- Visual Outputs: Real-time and replayable telemetry, plots, minimap, 3D trajectory trails, ghost drone estimates, and covariance ellipsoids.
- GNC Core: Rigid-body dynamics with RK4 integration, discrete EKF for state estimation, and cascade PID controllers.
- Replay & Storage: Runs are automatically saved and can be replayed nearly identically.
